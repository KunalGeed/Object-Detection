Object Detection with Python using YOLOv5
=========================================

Overview
--------

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves not only classifying images but also accurately estimating the concepts and locations of objects within those images. This GitHub repository presents a project focused on implementing object detection using Python, particularly leveraging the YOLOv5 model.

What is Object Detection?
-------------------------

Object detection encompasses various subtasks such as face detection, pedestrian detection, number plate detection, and skeleton detection. It plays a vital role in semantic understanding of images and videos, facilitating applications like image classification, human behavior analysis, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin, it's essential to install the necessary dependencies. You can achieve this by executing the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

bashCopy code

`pip install -qr yolov5/requirements.txt  # install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone repo`

Dataset Preparation
-------------------

Before diving into object detection with Python, it's crucial to load and prepare the dataset. In this project, the dataset includes images and corresponding bounding box annotations.

Training the Model
------------------

The next step involves training the object detection model using the prepared dataset. The YOLOv5 model is employed for this purpose.

Testing the Model
-----------------

Once the model is trained, it's imperative to evaluate its performance by testing it on sample images. This step ensures that the model effectively detects objects in images.

Conclusion
----------

This GitHub repository provides insights into implementing object detection with Python using the YOLOv5 model. By following the provided code snippets and instructions, you can develop a robust object detection system capable of identifying various objects within images. Feel free to explore the code further and contribute to enhancing object detection capabilities in the field of computer vision.
